          Although I was near top of my class, I had a difficult time adjusting to the world of Medicine. For all of it's esteem, being a care provider does not allow room for creativity- only charts and compliance. Sitting through a pharmacology lecture one afternoon, I had a shattering realization that I hadn't expressed any sort of genuine creativity in years.

        Since then you can say I have had an acute onset of coding fever. I love the process of solving problems; I love visualizing data and manipulating code to reach desired outcomes. I would get my fix whenever I could, coding recreationally on weekends and eventually through any and all biology lectures. After finishing my second year of Optometry school in good standing, I dropped out to further explore Computer Science and haven't looked back since.
